Before we can start writing Python, we need to make sure you have your environment set up. You just need a few things (some of which you might already have!)

- [ ] Check that Python is installed
- [ ] Check that Git is installed
- [ ] Clone this repository on your local machine

---

## Check that Python is installed

Your machine may already have Python, or you might need to install it. We also want to check that the right version of Python is present. To find out, go to your command line terminal and type: `python -V`

Make sure to use a capital `-V` or you'll get something very different. If you get an error or have a version less than 3, try this: `python3 -V` (again with the capital `-V`).

If you see your Python version displayed, you’re all set. Otherwise, you’ll need to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system. Make sure it's Python 3, as previous versions are deprecated.

## Check that Git is installed

We’ll use a similar approach to find out if you already have git installed. From your comment line, type: `git --version`

If you see your Git version displayed, you’re good to go. Otherwise, you’ll need to [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.

## Clone this repository on your local machine

Now we’re getting to the fun stuff. Let’s clone this repository to your local machine so that we can make some edits:
`git clone {{ repoUrl }}.git`

You can also download or clone the repo via SSH from the [main repo page]({{ repoUrl }}).

With your environment ready, let’s get started.
